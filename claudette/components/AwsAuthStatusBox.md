## Purpose
A UI component that displays the current status of AWS authentication, including ongoing processes, captured output, and any errors encountered during authentication.

## Imports
- **Stdlib**: None
- **External**: `react`
- **Internal**: `utils/awsAuthStatusManager`, `components/AwsAuthStatusBox`

## Logic
1. **Real-time Status Updates**:
    - Subscribes to a singleton manager (`AwsAuthStatusManager`) to receive continuous updates on the AWS authentication state.
    - Stores the latest status (including whether authentication is in progress, any errors, and recent output messages) in local component state.
2. **Conditional Visibility**: The component is only rendered if there's active information to display: either an ongoing authentication process, a recorded error, or recent log output. This prevents it from cluttering the UI when authentication is idle and successful.
3. **Information Display**:
    - Presents a clear, branded header: "Cloud Authentication".
    - Shows the last few lines of authentication output, with detected URLs automatically rendered as interactive links.
    - Displays any authentication errors prominently in a distinct error color.
4. **Visual Grouping**: Uses a bordered box with a specific color theme (`permission`) to visually delineate this status information from the main application content.

## Exports
- `AwsAuthStatusBox` - A functional component that displays the dynamic status of AWS authentication.
