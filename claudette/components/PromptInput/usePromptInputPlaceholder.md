## Purpose
Generates dynamic placeholder text for the prompt input based on current context such as viewing a teammate, queued commands, or first-time onboarding.

## Imports
- **Stdlib**: none
- **External**: `bun:bundle`, `react`
- **Internal**: `hooks/useCommandQueue`, `state/AppState`, `utils/config`, `utils/exampleCommands`, `utils/messageQueueManager`, `proactive` (conditional)

## Logic
1. Returns undefined when input is not empty
2. When viewing a teammate, shows "Message @{displayName}…" with truncated name if over 20 characters
3. When editable queued commands exist and hint hasn't been shown 3 times, shows "Press up to edit queued messages"
4. On first submission with suggestions enabled and not in proactive mode, shows an example command from cache
5. Skips example command in proactive mode since the model drives the conversation

## Exports
- `usePromptInputPlaceholder` - hook that returns placeholder string or undefined based on input state and context
