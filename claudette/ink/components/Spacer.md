## Purpose
Provides a Spacer component that creates flexible space expanding along the major axis of its containing layout, useful for distributing available space between elements.

## Imports
- **Stdlib**: None specified
- **External**: React from 'react'; React compiler runtime
- **Internal**: Box component from ./Box

## Logic
1. **Spacer Component**: A functional component that:
   - Uses React compiler runtime (_c) for optimized rendering and memoization
   - Returns a Box component with flexGrow={1} prop
   - The flexGrow property causes the spacer to expand and fill available space along the main axis of its parent layout (typically horizontal in a row or vertical in a column)

2. **Behavior**:
   - Acts as a flexible spacer that absorbs available space
   - When multiple spacers are present, they share available space equally
   - Useful for creating padding-like effects or pushing elements to edges
   - Functions similarly to CSS flex-grow: 1

3. **Implementation**:
   - Simple functional component with no internal state
   - Relies entirely on the Box component's layout capabilities
   - Uses compiler optimization for performance
