# compact.ts

## Purpose
Handles conversation compaction (summarization) to manage context window size. Creates condensed versions of long conversations while preserving important context, file state, and tool information for continued interaction.

## Imports
- **Stdlib**: `crypto` (UUID type), `lodash-es/uniqBy`
- **External**: `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (APIUserAbortError), feature flags via `bun:bundle`
- **Internal**: Session transcript, bootstrap state, hooks, tools (FileReadTool, ToolSearchTool), message types, API client, token utilities, attachment generators, analytics, forked agent utilities

## Logic
1. **Full Compaction (`compactConversation`)**: Summarizes entire conversation history into a compact summary message, preserving recent files, skills, plans, and tool context via attachments. Handles PTL (prompt-too-long) retries by truncating oldest API-round groups.

2. **Partial Compaction (`partialCompactConversation`)**: Summarizes only a portion of conversation around a pivot index. Direction 'from' keeps earlier messages with preserved cache; direction 'up_to' keeps later messages but invalidates cache prefix.

3. **Message Preprocessing**: Strips images/documents from messages before summarization (not needed for summary generation, prevents PTL on compact API call itself). Strips re-injected attachment types (skill_discovery, skill_listing) to save tokens.

4. **Streaming Summary Generation**: Uses forked agent with prompt cache sharing when enabled (98% cache hit rate). Falls back to regular streaming path. Sends keep-alive signals during long compaction to prevent WebSocket timeouts.

5. **Post-Compaction Attachments**: Re-announces deferred tools, agent listings, and MCP instructions so model retains tool context. Restores recently read files within token budget. Preserves invoked skills content with per-skill truncation. Attaches plan mode and async agent status.

6. **Hooks Integration**: Executes pre-compact hooks (can modify custom instructions), session-start hooks, and post-compact hooks to maintain extensibility.

7. **Telemetry**: Logs detailed analytics including token counts, cache metrics, PTL retry stats, and context analysis breakdowns.
